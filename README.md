# Maze Solver

A C++ implementation of a Maze data structure using graphs with four pathfinding algorithms. 
The implementation of the data structure aims to be memory efficient. The code is designed to be
easily adaptable to read and solve mazes of any format (for example from a file or through an image).
Four pathfinding algorithms are implemented: Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Dijkstra and A*.
